Our game for Ludum Dare 48


To use the source files:    
1. Clone the rpository locally  
2. Add the directory in Unity Hub  
3. Open it  
4. Press play  

To commit code safely read this https://unityatscale.com/unity-meta-file-guide/checklist-committing-unity-assets/  
In summary:  
1. If you add, delete rename or move assets, commit both the asset and its meta file. E.g. cube.png and cube.png.meta  
2. If you change an asset's setting in Unity's inspector window, commit its meta file.  
3. If you change the asset itself, then commit the asset. E.g. you painted over a png file, then commit that png file. The meta file remains the same.  
4. Don't commit changes that alter the GUID of a meta file.  
5. Don't commit empty folders and their meta files.  
6. Make sure that assets and their meta files have same filenames if you edited them using an external program.
